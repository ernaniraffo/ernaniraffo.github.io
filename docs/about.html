    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Hey, I'm Ernani Raffo.</p>

    <p>I graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor's
      in Science for
      Computer Science: Computer Game Design in 2024. In our capstone project,
      we developed a game in
      22 weeks. That's where <a href="/projects/crabity">Crabity</a> comes from!</p>

    <p>After graduating, I have been developing games on my own and in game
      jams.</p>

    <p>This website will hold the games and projects I have released and am developing, along
      with some developer logs for projects I am working on.</p>
