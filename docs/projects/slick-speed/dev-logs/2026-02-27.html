            <h2>Slick Speed: Post Mortem</h2>
            <time datetime="2026-02-23">February 23, 2026</time>

            <p>Slick Speed was created in 10 days for Bigmode Game Jam 2026 hosted on itch.io.
                The theme of the game jam was "Slick", a word used by Videogamedunkey while giving
                praise to great mechanics or moments in video games.

            <h3>What went right?</h3>
            <h4>Learning Unity 2D</h4>
            <p>
                For this game jam, I wanted to try something different than my other projects.
                I've always created games in Unity 3D and although I love creating mechanics in 3D
                space, I wanted to experiment making pixel art in 2D space. Textures definitely do
                not need to have a pixelated look for 2D games but after playing <em>Animal Well</em>
                last summer I was inspired to make a game using pixel art.
            </p>

                Game jams are always a great place to try and learn new things, and thanfully using
                the 2D engine instead of 3D went pretty smoothly. I definitely had some trouble at
                first to make sure the rendering settings were set properly for the pixel art that
                I made, but once I figured that out, it was easy to know the scale of my game
                objects. I picked 64x64 as the pixel art size which correspond to 1 unit in the
                game space, so 128x128 assets corresponded to 2, etc.
