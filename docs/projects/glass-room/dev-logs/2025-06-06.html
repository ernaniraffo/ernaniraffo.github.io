        Bug fix for Glass Room!
      </p>
      <p>
        Bug: When loading into the glass rooms, the player model phases
        through the moving cubes,
        causing the player to lose immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Root cause: The glass cubes' positions were being directly manipulated
        in the default
        update loop, instead of the fixed update loop used by the physics
        engine. Performing
        physics-like movement calculations in the default update loop can
        cause all kinds
        of undefined behavior, such as objects not detecting each other
        colliding!
      </p>
      <p>
        Fix: The calculations for the glass cubes' next position is now done
        in the fixed update
        loop! Load the game again and you will no longer fall through! At
        least not until the glass
        breaks...
