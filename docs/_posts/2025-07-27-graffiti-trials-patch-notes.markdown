As mentioned in my first dev log for Graffiti Trials, there were some bugs that hindered the
gameplay experience. The game has received two updates since then with those bugs fixed! Below are
the patch notes.

# Bug fixes
* Fixed NPC dialogue crashing the game when pressing the time trial button for the second time
* Fixed player jittering when moving and after colliding with objects
* Removed using graffiti while talking to the NPC

# Updates
* Added coyote frames allowing the player to jump even if they just starting falling from a platform
* Increased player speed while in the air

With these bug fixes and quality of life updates, players will have a better time going against
the time trial master. More updates coming soon, but for now, go beat 'em!
