            <h2>Slick Speed: Post Mortem</h2>
            <time datetime="2026-02-25">February 25, 2026</time>

            <p>Slick Speed was created in 10 days for Bigmode Game Jam 2026
                hosted on itch.io.
                The theme of the game jam was "Slick", a word used by
                Videogamedunkey while giving
                praise to great mechanics or moments in video games.
            </p>

            <h3>What went right?</h3>
            <h4>Making a 2D game</h4>
            <p>
                For this game jam, I wanted to try something different than my
                other projects. I've always created games in Unity 3D and
                although I love creating mechanics in 3D space, I wanted to
                experiment making pixel art and developing gameplay in a 2D
                space with a fixed camera. Textures definitely do not need to
                have a pixelated look for 2D games but after playing <em>Animal
                    Well</em>
                last summer I was inspired to make a game using pixel art.
            </p>
            <p>
                Game jams are always a great place to learn new things, and
                thankfully using the Unity 2D engine went pretty smoothly. I
                definitely had some trouble at first to make sure the rendering
                settings were set properly for the pixel art that I made, but
                once I figured that out, it was easy to know the scale of my
                game objects. I picked 64 as the pixel per unit base, so a
                height of 64 pixels for a given asset meant a height of 1 unit
                in the engine and same for the width.
            </p>
            <h4>Planning</h4>
            <p>
                The planning that went into Slick Speed was much better for this
                game jam compared to previous ones such as Graffiti Trials. The
                biggest mistake with Graffiti Trials during the jam was that I
                did not put sound or much UI in the game itself on release
                because my scope was too big for a 7 day jam where I worked my
                day job during the week. With the Bigmode Game Jam starting on a
                Thursday and lasting 10 days, I took Thursday and Friday to
                brainstorm, design, and plan what would eventually become Slick
                Speed on Saturday.
            </p>
            <p>
                My biggest goal for this jam was to make a game, even if very
                simple, that looked, felt, and sounded good. Here was my plan to
                achieve that:
            <ul>
                <li>Thursday/Friday: Brainstorm, design, plan</li>
                <li>Saturday: Prototype mechanics</li>
                <li>Sunday: Finalize mechanics</li>
                <li>Monday-Wednesday: Polish and balance gameplay loop, bug
                    fixes, playtests</li>
                <li>Thursday-Friday: Sound/UI, polish</li>
                <li>Saturday: Final polish and submit game</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The plan from Thursday to Wednesday went exactly as I had
                planned, but some of the bug fixes and playtesting did also move
                from Wednesday to Thursday, delaying the sound and
                user-interface elements to be done mostly Friday and Saturday.
