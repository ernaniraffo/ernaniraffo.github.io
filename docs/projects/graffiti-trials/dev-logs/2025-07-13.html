      <h3>What went right?</h3>

      <h4># 1: A physics-based character controller</h4>

      <p>
        For Graffiti Trials, the goal was to make a third-person character
        which did a couple of
        things: walk, jump, and spray graffiti. The walking and jumping of the
        character is
        self-explanatory, but my design for the graffiti spray was to apply a
        backwards
        force on the player when the graffiti can was used.
      </p>

      <p>
        For these mechanics, I would need to implement a character controller.
        I had two choices: use one of my previously made character controllers
        using Unity's
        built-in character controller class, or create one from scratch using
        rigid body physics.
        I chose the latter, as I wanted to have more control when applying the
        forces on the
        character, such as the graffiti spray force.
      </p>

      <p>
        The majority of the game jam period was spent on making sure the
        character controller felt
        responsive to the player input whether using a mouse and keyboard or
        on a controller.
        The main challenges of creating the character controller from scratch
        were figuring out how
        much force to apply during physics updates, how much damping to apply
        in the air versus on
        the ground, and collision detection with the ground. Showing the
        forces as gizmos in the
        Unity game scene and editor helped the debugging process
        significantly.

      <h4># 2: NPC dialogue system</h4>

      <p>
        For time trial courses, I wanted to have an NPC that serves as the
        time trial master for
        that course. For the scope of the game jam, this NPC would only ask
        you if you wanted to try
        the course, and once you had a time to your name, it would react to it
        depending on whether
        you beat their time or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        With just a little bit more than a day left of the game jam, I
        implemented an NPC dialogue
        manager that can be reused if new time trial courses are added to the
        game. This NPC dialogue manager has a
        dialogue camera which transitions from the main one once dialogue
        starts. It is also tied to a course manager,
        allowing the dialogue text to react to the player's time for a
        particular course.</p>

      <p>It would be pretty rude if the player still walked around, jumped, or
        even left the dialogue zone while
        talking
        to the time trial master, which is why I also implemented a state for
        the player while interacting with an
        NPC.
        This state stops the player from doing much else except for listening
        to what the time trial master has to
        say.
      </p>

      <h4># 3: The time trial mode</h4>

      <p>With less than 24 hours left, it was time to make the time trial
        mode. My favorite game that has a time trial
        mode is *Mario Kart Wii* and the way that it is handled (apart from
        tracking ghost data and displaying it
        during
        a time trial) is pretty simple. Like in a standard race, a countdown
        is displayed, and three laps need to be
        completed.</p>

      <p>Obviously, this game is much different. Since the theme of the game
        jam was to be around urban culture, I
        wanted to make something around parkouring. From this perspective, the
        player should just parkour their way to
        an endpoint. Once the player agreed to participate in the time trial,
        they would be placed in the start-point
        of
        the course where a countdown would start. They are then free to race
        to the pole-like object at the end of the
        course, where their time is saved and compared against their best (if
        they had already raced).</p>

      <p>They could of course fall from the map on their way to the end. If
        this happens, I added some borders which
        respawn the player and stop the timer of their time trial. With the
        time trial mode and parkouring being the
        core gameplay of the game, I was content with the replayability and
        the ability to get better scores.</p>

      <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
      <h4># 1: Game polish</h4>

      <p>In game development, "juice" must be accounted for. This key part of
        the game development process only took
        place in the last few hours before submission, where I still needed to
        add:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A character model with multiple animations and animation states
        </li>
        <li>A particle effect for using the graffiti can feature</li>
        <li>A skybox instead of Unity's default</li>
        <li>Materials and colors to go on the levels, characters, and UI</li>
        <li>Sounds while playing and interacting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fortunately, I was able to crunch most of the features in time. For
        the models, I made them straight out of
        Unity's ProBuilder tool, which I believe worked out well. I find
        making the models using primitive shapes to
        be
        quite fun and was pleased with the end result. The particle effect for
        the graffiti can is implemented using
        Unity's default particle effect. While it works with the spray
        animation, the effect is basic and could have
        been enhanced if more time was spent on it or by exploring a custom
        shader. The skybox used in graffiti trials
        was from the Unity Asset Store by <a
          href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/real-stars-skybox-lite-116333"
          target="_blank">Geoff Dallimore</a>, and the materials and colors
        used were selected from a color palette
        for
        the game and applied with metallic and smoothness values. At this
        point, there was no time left to continue
        working on the game, which is why there's no music or sounds.</p>

      <p>Sound in games is very important. When linked to interactions, it
        provides a confirmation to the player that
        they are performing an action or that something is happening around
        them. Looking back at the project, these
        cues could have been added as the player states were being developed
        such as the walking, jumping, and
        spraying
        graffiti. They could have also helped in finding bugs earlier when
        making the character controller, as I would
        be able to tell if the forces being applied happened multiple times or
        once, such as the jumping force for
        example.</p>

      <h4># 2: Testing builds</h4>

      <p>Something that I wish I had done much earlier during the development
        process was to create game builds
        periodically and test its functionality on the itch.io website and on
        its own. There are multiple benefits to
        periodically building the game especially given the short duration of
        the game jam.</p>

      <p>One of those benefits is playtesting. I had a couple of people try
        the game out once it was done, and it was
        obvious to see what was missing from the game to better their
        experience. By playtesting earlier builds, I
        could
        have prioritized aspects of the game which would help player
        enjoyment.</p>
      <p>Another is to check if the build is mostly bug-free. Unfortunately in
        my case, there was a critical bug that
        crashed the game once the player attempted to retry the time trial
        course. To work around this, they would
        have
        to reload the page every time they wanted to retry the course. While
        developing and testing the game in Unity,
        the game did not crash during this interaction. However, by testing
        builds periodically, I would have caught
        and
        fixed the bug before submitting the game.</p>

      <h3>What are the next steps?</h3>

      <p>While the core foundations of the game are implemented, many aspects
        can still be reworked.</p>

      <p>The next steps for <i>Graffiti Trials</i> are to fix bugs and add
        overall game polish. This would include
        fixing the UI bug that crashes the game, adding an in-game tutorial,
        polishing the character models and
        animations, and adding sound effects to interactions. After completing
        this step, playtesting will be crucial
        to
        get feedback on the gameplay.</p>

      <p>Once the game reaches a polished state and the gameplay feels good to
        players, more levels and NPCs can be
        added to test their skills further!
