Graffiti Trials just got its biggest update yet, providing a more polished and fun playing experience.

The focus of this update was to add better interactions through sounds and animations, and to improve
the user experience through user interface and in-game characters.

# Updates
* Added sounds for several interactions
* Added animations while interacting with non-playable characters
* Added tutorial and guides via a new friend
* Added a graffiti can icon displaying the amount of spray paint available to use
* Added indicator that the time trial is complete
* Added a title screen to start the game with options to play, view stats, or change options
* Added a pause menu
* Enhanced controller support and input device switching
* Modified Course 1's level design
* Added trees by Course 1
* Added cursor locking while playing and unlocking while interacting with UI
* Modified font style

# Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue where jumping near the time trial master and immediately interacting with them
crashed the game
* Fixed higher jumps near non-playable characters
* Fixed a typo in the time trial master dialogue

Thank you to everyone who playtested the game and provided quality feedback. Everyone had great and
interesting ideas for the future of *Graffiti Trials*. If you have any more, message me!

The time trial master is waiting for a worthy opponent. Go practice and beat 'em! You never know
when more of them may appear.
