My name is Ernani Raffo.

I graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor's in Science for
Computer Science: Computer Game Design in 2024.
In our capstone project, we developed a game in 22 weeks. That's where [Crabity]({{ site.url }}{% link games/crabity.md %}) comes from!

After graduating, I have been developing games on my own and in game jams.

This website will hold the games I have released and am developing, along with some developer blogs
for specific games I am working on.
