      <h2>Graffiti Trials: Patch Notes</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-07-27">July 27, 2025</time>

      <p>
        As mentioned in my first dev log for Graffiti Trials, there were some
        bugs that hindered the
        gameplay experience. The game has received two updates since then with
        those bugs fixed! Below are
        the patch notes.
      </p>

      <h3>Bug fixes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed NPC dialogue crashing the game when pressing the time trial
          button for the second time</li>
        <li>Fixed player jittering when moving and after colliding with objects
        </li>
        <li>Removed using graffiti while talking to the NPC</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Updates</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added coyote frames allowing the player to jump even if they just
          starting falling from a platform</li>
        <li>Increased player speed while in the air</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With these bug fixes and quality of life updates, players will have a
        better time going against the time trial master. More updates coming
        soon, but for now, go beat 'em!
      </p>
